## About The Project



Write a chat program in C/C++ that provides:
* Authentication of correspondents
* Message secrecy (encryption)
* Message integrity (MACs)

GoalsÔºö
* Gain familiarity using cryptographic libraries (openssl).
* Experience in protocol design.
* Understanding various issues in network programming.
* How to avoid common software security issues.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project was running successful on Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites

* ncurses and its header files. If you are on linux/BSD, you might have to get a package like ncurses-devel or similar, although some distributions (e.g. Arch Linux) will include header files in the normal package (no -devel needed).

* readline and the header files (readline-devel).

* openssl and headers (openssl-devel).

* gmp and its header files (gmp-devel).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/clhqzx/CSC380Project1.git
   ```
3. Open terminal on the file, and running make
   ```sh
   make
   ```
4. Begin to run chat, open two terminal windows

   one run
   ```js
   ./chat -l
   ```
   the other one run
   ```js
   ./chat -c YOUR SERVER'S IP ADDRESS
   ```
5. Start to chat!
